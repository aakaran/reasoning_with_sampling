          <p>
            Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, 
            driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, 
            despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to 
            disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable 
            reasoning capabilities can be elicited from base models at inference time, <strong>without any 
            additional training</strong>. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling 
            from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base 
            models' own likelihoods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that 
            nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including 
            MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple 
            samples that is characteristic of RL posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated 
            datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            RL has emerged as the central paradigm to enhance reasoning capabilities in frontier models,
            leading to substantial boosts in performance across domains such as mathematics and coding. At the same time,
            there is evidence to suggest that the reasoning chains that emerge after RL-posttraining are well within base model
            capabilities. For example, we can plot the log likelihoods and confidences (i.e., negative average per-token entropies)
            of outputs <strong>with respect to the base model distribution</strong> and observe that RL outputs tightly concentrate around 
            high likelihood and high confidence regions of the base model. This points towards an effective <strong>distribution sharpening</strong>,
            where RL shifts probability mass from low-likelihood sequences to high-likelihood ones. 
          </p>
          <div style="text-align:center; margin: 24px 0;">
            <img src="combined_hists.png" alt="Combined Histograms" width="90%">
          </div>
          <p>
            Motivated by this observation, we introduce sampling from the <strong>power distribution</strong> \( p^{\alpha} \), 
            which naturally sharpens the base model distribution \(p\) by upweighting high-likelihood sequences via exponentiation. 
            Crucially, unlike simple low-temperature sampling, power distributions account for future completion 
            likelihoods, favoring tokens with fewer but higher likelihood future paths. This is especially valuable for reasoning tasks, 
            as it encourages avoiding "critical windows" or "pivotal tokens" that trap outputs in low-likelihood futures.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="title is-4">Autoregressive MCMC Sampling</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Directly sampling from \( p^{\alpha} \) is intractable, as it requires normalizing over a sequence space that 
            is exponential in length. To get around this, we employ a Metropolis-Hastings (MCMC) method to approximately 
            sample from the unnormalized distribution \( p^{\alpha} \). Metropolis-Hastings iteratively updates a sample
            generation \(\mathbf{x}\) by proposing a new candidate \(\mathbf{x'}\) and accepting the change with some probability
            \(A(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x'})\) which depends on the \( p^{\alpha} \) weights. We illustrate the process below:


            In general, Metropolis-Hastings can require exponentially many iterative updates before converging to sampling from 
            \( p^{\alpha} \) with such a large sequence space. To avoid this curse of dimensionality, we build the output block-by-block,
            using Metropolis-Hastings to sample from \( p^{\alpha} \) for progressively longer sequences. This amounts to probabilistic iterative 
            resampling informed by base model likelihoods.

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Defining intermediate distributions</strong>: We progressively sample from distributions

            Our work demonstrates that <strong>base models are significantly more capable at reasoning than 
            standard sampling methods reveal</strong>. The success of Power Sampling suggests:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>High-likelihood regions of base models strongly correlate with correct reasoning</li>
            <li>Additional inference-time compute can unlock latent reasoning capabilities</li>
            <li>RL posttraining may primarily perform distribution sharpening rather than learning fundamentally 
            new behaviors</li>
            <li>Training-free methods can extend reasoning beyond easily verifiable domains where RL struggles</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This opens promising directions for enhancing reasoning capabilities through better understanding and 
            utilization of base model distributions, rather than relying solely on expensive posttraining procedures.
